# Overview

For this project, I wanted to learn how to use Ruby and its framework Rails. I've been drawn to Ruby for a couple of different reasons. First, my older brother loves it and wants me to learn. Second, it's focus on simplicity and productivity. The mantra that Rails uses, "Convention over configuration" is very appealing to me, and so I wanted to get an insight into how it does that.

# Development Environment

To accomplish this, I used Ruby, the Rails framework, and a Sqlite3 database. Overall, a pretty simple tech stack but these three alone can pack quite a punch for making web apps.

# Useful Websites

This wouldn't have been possible without the active community for Ruby on Rails and the guides available from the official documentation, go check it out if you're like me and want to learn a bit more about it!

- [RailsGuides](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/index.html)

# Future Work

As far as future improvements, I've got a few but mostly it's aesthetic improvements.

- First, I'd like to clean it up and turn it into something resembling a real website, rather than just basic cards.
- I'd also like to add some validation to make sure that anything submitted into the website is secure.
- Last, I'd like to make some basic user authentication and make some basic account information.
